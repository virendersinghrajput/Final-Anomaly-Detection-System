IoT Anomaly Detection & Device Identification with Context Awareness
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and associated results for my dissertation project on IoT anomaly detection and device identification using the CIC IoT-DIAD 2024 dataset.
The project evaluates multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in two phases:

Anomaly Detection without Context Awareness â€“ Flow-based Anomaly Detection using statistical and temporal features.

Anomaly Detection with Context Awareness â€“ Device identity (from packet-level classification) injected into flow-based anomaly detection.

Device Identification â€“ Predicting the IoT device identity from packet-level features.
